  <ul>  <b> Module 1 – Into the Cloud - The story of getting to the Cloud </b>
What are the business drivers and technologies that have led to the Digital Transformation that is driving us to the Cloud. We follow the rise of the internet and the contributions of Sir Tim in developing the World Wide Web that triggered IoT and the tidal wave of data. He wanted to make the data from CERN visible to others across the world. By devising HTML the markup languate and HTTP the protocol layered on TCP he made this widely successful. In the early 2000s the rise of IoT, invented here at MIT allowed not only passive access to data already in storage but access to "live" data generated by IoT devices.</ul><br>
<ul>
<b>Module 2 Big Data, Open Source Software and the Cloud (Bread Machine on Steriods) </b>
The story of IoT is one of devices that gather data and connect to servers that aggregate that data into powerful data stores. We trace the rise of the Browser as a data integrator that allows us to scale our systems across the world. 
At the same time we trace the affect of Open Source Software as a driver of rapid innovation. In particular we look at Node.js, JavaScript and NPM (Node Package Manager) in allowing companies to build powerful web platforms.  In our exercises we look the importance of Web Servers, URLs and Routes that allow us to connect to and control devices across the world. Using these we can control a camera in our home or in Hong Kong with the same ease - physical distance being no problem
</ul><br>
<ul>
<b>Module 3 - Containers and Orchestration</b>
Containers, such as Docker allow users to run images that are independent of operating system. We will use Docker to download an image that already exists in DockerHub and run it in a Docker container on our laptop.</ul><br>

<b>Module 4 – DevOps (lots of material on this) </b>
</ul><br>
<ul>
There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. Quote by C.A.R. Hoare, 1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture
Today software development has moved from designers throwing their software "over-the-wall" to testers and the testers repeating the process with software operations. Now these roles are disappearing and there are just software engineers who design, test and deploy their software. 
In order to simplify the complexity of the product designers strip it down to the Minimal Viable Product. They don’t put in any feature that is not absolutely necessary.

<b>Module 5 – DevOpsTest,  DevOpsSec  (the story of Microsoft, Level 1, Level 2,…)</b>

<b>Module 6 – Serverless </b>

<b>Module 7 - The Agile Corporation</b>
For the last hundred years companies have been applying optimization techniques to improve their "core" business. Today over 50% of the FT 500 companies from 2000 are gone. Will your company be next? Remember size is no defense. General Electric is stumbling, BlackBerry is gone as is Nokia, a $150 billion corporation. 
One major insight is that data is the new "gold". Every company needs data about its products, and how they perform. Every company needs data about its customers. 
As we saw in the bread making exercise, product design is not just about the physical entity, its also about the embedded chips which monitor the product and send data back to the manufacturer. Its about understanding how your customer uses your product and how they would like your product to perform. 
In order for a company to compete it must be agile - we call it the New Agile Corporation. Here we discuss what it means to be agile.</ul><br><ul>

    <h5>Web Servers and Web Sites</h5>
    The story of IoT is one of devices that gather data and connect to servers that aggregate that data into powerful data stores. We trace the rise of the Browser as a data integrator that allows us to scale our systems across the world. <br>
    We show how to gather data from hundreds or thousands of sensors or to control those sensors just using a Web Servers.<br>
      At the same time we trace the effect of Open Source Software as a driver of rapid innovation. In particular we look at Node.js, JavaScript and NPM (Node Package Manager) in allowing companies to build powerful web platforms. <br>

    In our exercises we look the importance of Web Servers, URLs and Routes that allow us to connect to and control devices across the world. Using these we can control a camera in our home or in Hong Kong with the same ease - physical distance being no problem.<br>
    We also look at two standards for communication, namely HTTP and Web Sockets. HTTP is a simple protocol, which is so small it can be written on a business card. It is the standard for communicating with a Browser to a Web Server. Its "header" contains information about the browser, the machine IP and port address that its sent from and the machine IP and port address of its destination. For security HTTPS also includes a mechanism for encryption, which makes communication more secure. The downside of HTTP and HTTPS is that its a fairly bulky header and therefore we often switch to Web Sockets once communication has been "set-up". <br>
    In the exercise below we show how to set up a simple message server which can send messages to a group of people who only can communicate via their browser. <br>

  <h5 class="card-header">Module 3 - Containers and Orchestration</h5>
Containers, such as Docker allow users to run images that are independent of operating system. We will use Docker to download an image that already exists in DockerHub and run it in a Docker container on our laptop. This means that anyone can now distribute their code by creating a Docker image. This image can run on any operating system because it will run in a standardized Docker container. <br>
Now suppose I want to set up several docker containers (lets say 3 containers called A, B and C) on my laptop all running the same code and I want them to all communicate, say on port 3000. If you think about it, this raises a problem. The message header from any container will contain the machine name and the port number. But my machine only has one port 3000 so how does it know which container is its correct destination? The answer is that each container can map its port 3000 to different machine level ports. So container A port 3000 --> 8001, B port 3000 --> 8002, and C port 3000 --> 8003.  So a message address to IP X:8002 will go to container B port 3000. This mapping is done in the Dockerfile and its a very powerful mechanism for testing code. (maybe an Exercise on this would be good).<br>

Repeated operations are systematized and optimized and decisions are driven by actual data gleened from testing and actual deployment. <br>

The history of DevOps has its roots in manufacturing, going back to the Toyota Production System, Theory of Constraints, and Lean Engineering. Below we trace this history and explain how DevOps has transformed software. <br>
